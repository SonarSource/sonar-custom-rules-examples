Custom Python rules
=======
The python custom-rules plugin template moved to a better place!

To learn how to write custom rules, please refer to the documentation embedded directly in the Open Source SonarSource Python Analyzer Repository, available here: [SonarSource/sonar-python](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-python). 

The Python Analyzer repository contains a [template maven project](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-python/blob/master/docs/python-custom-rules-example/) to start writing custom rules fast. This template will be up-to-date with the latest releases of the Python Analyzer.
