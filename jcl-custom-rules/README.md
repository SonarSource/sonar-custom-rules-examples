This example demonstrates how to write **Custom Rules** for SonarJCL.

This example assumes that the jar file of the JCL plugin is available in the `lib` directory.
You can download sonar-jcl-plugin-1.2.0.1148.jar from the [SonarSource binaries repository](https://binaries.sonarsource.com/CommercialDistribution/sonar-jcl-plugin/sonar-jcl-plugin-1.2.0.1148.jar).
